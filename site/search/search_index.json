Accounts Required (Preliminary) A GitHub Account A Google Account A Zotero Account Setup Before using the workflow, the necessary software must be installed. The necessary software is provided in the Installation section. The workflow also involves templates which can be used over and over again for multiple research topics. Said templates are hosted online via the same workflow and can be accessed through the Templates section. The Workflow Data Collection Before writing content, the team must collect sufficient data from both Related Literature and Empirical Evidence. Reference Data When the team presents a research proposal, there is no Empirical Evidence, and the only basis is from Related Literature. At this stage, using their Internet browser and Zotero, each team member searches for resources that might be relevant to the research topic. They then share the references and the respective digital copies that they find to their Group Library for other team members to see. This prevents redundancy as references that are found and annotated by one team member need not be searched for and annotated by another team member. The team can also share notes on the references that are found, leading to a more in-depth discussion of the work. This occurs for several more relevant literature found by the team, and each team member has a copy of the annotated bibliography produced. Empirical Data Once the research proposal is accepted, the team can proceed to collecting Empirical Data. The process varies from field to field, however, the methodology must be closely-tied to the related literature. During this time, the team may also add new sources or insights on the references stored in the Group Library. Collaborative Content Management Using GitHub, progress and relevant changes can be stored in the team repository, forked from the Forkable GitHub Repository . Non-LaTeX information such as the photo documentation or important insights may be stored on the team repository. Data gathered (e.g. spreadsheets) can be stored in Google Sheets , with its own version control system . These spreadsheets, through the use of Formatted Paste with LaTeX Utilites can be easily integrated into the LaTeX Documents. Progress on the Research Project itself can be tracked via GitHub, with comment and issue threads. Project Boards can be set up for each logical division of the Research Project, noting the progress of each issue. These Project Boards can double as the planning calendar, removing the need for making a physical copy of the Planning Calendar. Research Teachers and Advisers can also watch their team's repository, removing the need to produce a Project Monitoring Documents such as Weekly Accomplishment Reports (WARs). Peer rating is still advised however, as not everything accomplished in the research is done on a computer. The structure of the repository tree will be as follows: one master branch (for the most publishable output), and one developmental branch for each team member (the research teacher and adviser are also considered team members) with the naming format member_name . In each developmental branch, the respective team member may make unlimited changes to the files and commits to the branch. The team member may also make their own sub-branches to organize their developmental branch with the naming format member_name-subbranchname . After making changes, the team member may make a pull request . When a team member begins a pull request, discussions may ensue on why said changes are necessary. Other members can comment on the changes as well as add commits to revise them. The GitHub Repository can also double as a daily journal, since important events such as breakthroughs in the research are recorded with a timestamp. Content Writing Using LaTeX, the team can write without regard for the format, as the template ensures that the papers will always follow the format. The combination of Zotero and LaTeX produces automatic citations and bibliography, removing the need to copy and paste. This means that the team can focus more on writing content, instead of on minor details such as formatting content and citations/bibliographies.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#collaborative-research-paper-writing-workflow","text":"A workflow for research paper-writing crafted for efficiency.","title":"Collaborative Research Paper-Writing Workflow"},{"location":"#accounts-required-preliminary","text":"A GitHub Account A Google Account A Zotero Account","title":"Accounts Required (Preliminary)"},{"location":"#setup","text":"Before using the workflow, the necessary software must be installed.

Source Code Management Git Graph by mhutchie Git Graph provides a visualization of your git repository, enabling you to track changes and revert them if necessary. Git Source Code Management (SCM) Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. \u2014 https://git-scm.com/ Git SCM eases the collaborative editing process by synchronizing changes across connected devices. Git SCM is naturally supported by Visual Studio Code , which makes staging changes, producing commits and fetching changes in a remote repository easy and quick, accessible with one click . A comprehensive tutorial is available here: Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub MikTeX MikTeX enables you to compile the str-templates and compile your modified versions, providing PDF output that is ready-to-print and ready-to-publish. MikTeX ensures that you don't download thousands of bytes of packages you will never use in your lifetime. It supports on-the-fly download and installation of packages that are used within TeX documents that you run. To ensure that MikTeX does not bother you with install prompts every time a missing package is detected, please switch the Install missing packages on-the-fly dropdown list to Yes during the installation process, as shown here: A comprehensive tutorial is available here: LaTeX for Beginners Zotero Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, cite, and share research. \u2014 https://www.zotero.org/ A comprehensive tutorial for Zotero is available here: Zotero User Guide A brief tutorial for Better BibTeX is available here: Referencing, Citing, and Structuring Bibliographies Bibliography Management Zotero manages all your references, including publication information as well as the digital copies and notes you have on each reference. One-click Reference Storage Just use the Zotero browser connector to automatically store your references from Google Scholar and other official sites. Examples are shown here on this webpage . Do note however that Zotero connector works best with Google Scholar and storing references directly from an official article-hosting site works only about 75% of the time. You may add the reference by identifier as fallback . If all else fails, you may manually add or edit your references yourself . Online Hosting Zotero provides online hosting to your libraries for free. You can share your online libraries with other users of the network, thus making collaboration much easier, with shared references between team members. Browser Support Zotero provides extensions for the most common web browsers available which makes collecting reference information quick and easy. Citations via BibLaTeX Zotero can produce .bib files for citations via BibLaTeX. These citations are automatically added to the bibliography of your document. Better BibTeX by retorquere Better BibTeX optimizes Zotero for producing .bib files, and can update the files automatically should changes be made in the library associated with them. Optional Software LTeX by Julian Valentin LTeX uses LanguageTool to provide spelling and grammatical corrections as you type, saving you time for editing typographical errors. Do note however that it requires an installation of Java 8 or higher and requires other extensions for English and Tagalog Support.","title":"Applications"},{"location":"applications/#applications","text":"","title":"Applications"},{"location":"applications/#perl","text":"Perl is a requirement for builds via LaTeX Workshop .

Whenever the str-templates repository is updated, the template files in the forked repository can be updated using submodule update . Forking the repository To use the Forkable GitHub Repository, create a free GitHub Account and then simply fork from this repository and rename your fork based on your research title (e.g. research_title ) . First Run To use the templates, you must clone the fork into your computer via Git GUI . The following images show how the typical clone prompt will look like: After cloning, rename the folders and files to change research_title into your actual research title. After renaming everything, you may now initialize MikTeX. To initialize MikTeX, you must first make sure that MikTeX Console is running . After making sure that MikTeX is running, you may now open the research_title folder via Visual Studio Code. Opening a folder is an option on the Welcome page (under the Start section) of Visual Studio Code, as shown here: After opening the folder, a navigation bar will appear showing all the files in the folder. Make sure that what you see in the following image is similar to what you see in Visual Studio Code: Open research_title-journal.tex and then press Ctrl + S to begin building the file. A progress bar will appear. Note: You need an Internet connection for the first compilation to initialize MikTeX. This is what your window should look like: To use text wrapping, press Alt + Z . To preview the PDF file produced, click the Preview button on the upper right corner of the window or press Ctrl + Alt + V . Using these commands will lead to a workspace that looks like this: Do the same process for research_title-traditional.tex to initialize MikTeX for the Traditional Paper. Your workspace will now look similar to this: First Commit and Push After performing the renaming and the initial runs, Git will automatically detect changes. Use Visual Studio Code to commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository . Traditional Paper The Traditional Paper Template provides almost every macro required to write a properly formatted and complete paper, as well as writing tips from various sources. Simply follow and delete each TODO comment in the file, filling in the content sections. You may add TODO and FIXME comments in the file to take note of tasks in writing.

Use the information in the Traditional Paper to produce an abridged version of your Traditional Paper that fits in seven pages. The process is the same, simply follow and delete each TODO comment in the file, filling in the content sections. You may also add TODO and FIXME comments in the file to take note of tasks in writing. Once all the highlighted comments are removed, your article is complete.

# The LaTeX Templates
The LaTeX templates are provided in the [str-templates repository](https://github.com/MasterToast10/str-templates)
## Forkable GitHub Repository 
There is also a Forkable GitHub Repository that is ready to be used as a template and optimized for use within the workflow.
First, [create a free GitHub Account](https://github.com/join) and then simply [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) from [this repository](https://github.com/MasterToast10/str-templates-forkable) and clone it into your computer via VS Code ([tutorial here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_cloning-a-repository)).
## First Run with MikTeX
Before you experiment with the content in your cloned repository, you must first initialize MikTeX by making sure that [MikTeX Console is running](https://miktex.org/howto/miktex-console) and then compiling the `research_title-journal.tex` and `research_title-traditional.tex` files by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.
## Traditional Paper
The Traditional Paper Template provides almost every macro required to write a properly formatted and complete paper, as well as writing tips from various sources. 
Simply follow and delete each `TODO` comment in the file, filling in the content sections.
You may add `TODO` and `FIXME` comments in the file to take note of tasks in writing.
Once all the highlighted comments are removed, your paper is complete.
## Journal Article
Once your Traditional Paper is complete, you may move on to writing your Journal Article.
Use the information in the Traditional Paper to produce an abridged version of your Traditional Paper that fits in seven pages.
The process is the same, simply follow and delete each `TODO` comment in the file, filling in the content sections.
You may also add `TODO` and `FIXME` comments in the file to take note of tasks in writing.
Once all the highlighted comments are removed, your article is complete.

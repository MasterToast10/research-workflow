# The LaTeX Templates
The LaTeX templates are provided in the [str-templates repository](https://github.com/MasterToast10/str-templates)
## Forkable GitHub Repository 
There is also a Forkable GitHub Repository that is ready to be used as a template and optimized for use within the workflow.
Whenever the str-templates repository is updated, the template files in the forked repository can be updated using [submodule update](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule).
To use the Forkable GitHub Repository, [create a free GitHub Account](https://github.com/join) and then simply [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) from [this repository](https://github.com/MasterToast10/str-templates-forkable), [rename your fork based on your research title (e.g. `research_title`)](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/renaming-a-repository), and then [clone it into your computer via Git GUI](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/git-on-windows-for-newbs--net-25847).

The following images show how the typical clone prompt will look like:

## First Run with MikTeX on Visual Studio Code
Before you experiment with the content in your cloned repository, you must first initialize MikTeX by making sure that [MikTeX Console is running](https://miktex.org/howto/miktex-console) and compiling the `research_title-journal.tex` and `research_title-traditional.tex` files on Visual Studio Code by [opening](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/editingevolved) and pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> on each file.
## Traditional Paper
The Traditional Paper Template provides almost every macro required to write a properly formatted and complete paper, as well as writing tips from various sources. 
Simply follow and delete each `TODO` comment in the file, filling in the content sections.
You may add `TODO` and `FIXME` comments in the file to take note of tasks in writing.
Once all the highlighted comments are removed, your paper is complete.
## Journal Article
Once your Traditional Paper is complete, you may move on to writing your Journal Article.
Use the information in the Traditional Paper to produce an abridged version of your Traditional Paper that fits in seven pages.
The process is the same, simply follow and delete each `TODO` comment in the file, filling in the content sections.
You may also add `TODO` and `FIXME` comments in the file to take note of tasks in writing.
Once all the highlighted comments are removed, your article is complete.
